 * Get the current user profile for the current workspace.

 * NOTE: this function can only be used if we are within a route
 * that has a loaded workspace. Otherwise, we cannot get the user
 * profile because each user profile is linked to a workspace.
 *
 * If you are outside of a workspace, use `useAuth` instead to get
 * the authenticated DB user, but this will not give you any profile
 * data because a profile requires a workspace.
 *
 * @returns A tuple containing the user profile and a boolean
 * indicating if the data is loading.
